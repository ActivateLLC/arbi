## ⚡ Immediate Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables on Railway (2 minutes)

**Required for Basic Operation:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

**Optional but Recommended (for full functionality):**

#### eBay Data Scout (FREE)
```bash
EBAY_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
# Get at: https://developer.ebay.com/join
# Takes 5 minutes to sign up
```

#### Amazon Data via Rainforest ($49/mo, 1000 free requests)
```bash
RAINFOREST_API_KEY=your_key_here
# Get at: https://www.rainforestapi.com/
```

#### Stripe Payments (FREE to start)
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
# Get from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
```

#### Cloudinary Image Hosting (FREE tier)
```bash
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
# Sign up at: https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free
```

#### PostgreSQL Database (add via Railway)
```bash
# In Railway Dashboard:
# 1. Click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
# 2. Railway will auto-set these variables:
DB_HOST=postgres.railway.internal
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=railway
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=<auto-generated>
DB_SSL=true
```

---

### Step 2: Push to Deploy (30 seconds)

```bash
# Commit the fix
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Remove pandas-js dependency to resolve babel-runtime issue"

# Push to Railway branch
git push origin claude/explain-arbitrage-01RJPqHKfTH7mgPvuDvhAXqs
```

Railway will automatically:
1. Detect the push
2. Run `pnpm install && pnpm build`
3. Start with `pnpm --filter @arbi/api start`
4. Deploy to production URL

---

### Step 3: Verify Deployment (1 minute)

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_URL with your Railway app URL
RAILWAY_URL="https://your-app.up.railway.app"

# 1. Health check
curl $RAILWAY_URL/health

# 2. Find opportunities (requires at least one scout configured)
curl "$RAILWAY_URL/api/arbitrage/opportunities?minProfit=10"

# 3. Autonomous engine status
curl "$RAILWAY_URL/api/autonomous/opportunities?limit=10"

# 4. Marketplace health (zero-capital model)
curl "$RAILWAY_URL/api/marketplace/health"
```
