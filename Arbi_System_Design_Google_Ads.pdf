# Arbi System Design & Google Ads API Integration

## Overview
Arbi is an autonomous arbitrage and e-commerce automation platform. It discovers profitable opportunities, automates product listings, and manages ad campaigns across multiple platforms, including Google Ads, to maximize user revenue.

## Architecture
- **Core Engine:** AI-driven arbitrage and opportunity analysis
- **Data Sources:** eBay, Amazon, Walmart, Target, Rainforest API, and more
- **Automation:** Web scraping, product listing, order fulfillment, and ad campaign management
- **Ad Integration:** Automated creation and optimization of Google Shopping and Display campaigns for listed products
- **User Management:** Each user authorizes their own ad account; no data is shared between users

## Google Ads API Usage
- **Purpose:** Programmatically create, manage, and optimize ad campaigns for products listed by users
- **Flow:**
  1. User lists a product on Arbi
  2. Arbi creates a landing page and launches a Google Shopping/Display campaign via the API
  3. Campaign performance is monitored and optimized automatically
  4. All actions require explicit user authorization
- **Security:**
  - OAuth2 is used for user consent and authentication
  - No reselling or external sharing of Google Ads data
  - All API usage is compliant with Google Ads API policies

## Business Model
- **Commission-based:** Arbi earns a percentage of profits generated for users
- **No subscription fees:** Incentives are aligned with user success

## Compliance & Best Practices
- Only manages ads for authorized accounts
- Follows Google Ads API Terms of Service and access level requirements
- Data is isolated per user; no cross-account data sharing
- Secure storage of all credentials and tokens
