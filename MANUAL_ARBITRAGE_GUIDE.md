## 🎯 THE SIMPLE 3-STEP PROCESS

### Step 1: Find Underpriced Items (15 min)

**Best Categories for Beginners:**
- Electronics (phones, tablets, gaming)
- Brand name clothing (Nike, Adidas, Lululemon)
- Collectibles (Pokemon cards, vintage toys)
- Tools (power tools, hand tools)
- Books (textbooks, rare editions)

**Where to Source:**
1. **eBay Auctions Ending Soon**
   - Search: "nike shoes" (or your category)
   - Filter: Auction → Ending Soonest
   - Look for: Items with 0-2 bids, ending in <2 hours
   - Target: Buy It Now prices 30-50% below market

2. **Facebook Marketplace**
   - Search your local area
   - Look for: "Moving sale", "Need gone today"
   - Target: Items listed under "desperate seller" conditions

3. **Garage Sales/Estate Sales**
   - Saturday mornings (8am-10am are best)
   - Bring cash
   - Use your phone to check eBay sold prices on-site

**Quick Profit Check:**
```
1. Find item price on eBay (buy source)
2. Check "Sold listings" on eBay for same item
3. Calculate:
   Selling Price - Buy Price - Fees (15%) - Shipping ($5-15) = Profit
4. If profit > $10 and ROI > 30% → BUY IT
```

### Step 2: List on eBay (5 min per item)

**Fast Listing Template:**

**Title (80 chars max):**
```
[Brand] [Model] [Key Feature] [Condition] [Bonus Keywords]

Example:
Apple iPhone 13 Pro 128GB Unlocked Graphite - Excellent Condition
```

**Price Strategy:**
- Check 5-10 recent sold listings
- Price at **median sold price** (not average)
- Or use "Buy It Now" at 90% of sold average + "Best Offer" enabled

**Photos:**
- Take 6-12 clear photos
- Include: Front, back, sides, any flaws, serial numbers
- Use good lighting (natural light by window is best)

**Description:**
```
[BRAND NEW/LIKE NEW/EXCELLENT] Condition

What's Included:
- Item
- Original box (if applicable)
- Accessories

Condition Notes:
[Be honest about any flaws]

Ships within 1 business day via USPS Priority Mail.

Returns accepted within 30 days.
```

**Shipping:**
- Set to "Free Shipping" (build cost into price)
- Use calculated shipping if item is heavy
- Always use tracking

---

### Step 3: Ship & Profit (1 hour)

**When Item Sells:**
1. Buy shipping label on eBay (get discount)
2. Package securely (bubble wrap, sturdy box)
3. Drop at post office same day
4. Upload tracking number to eBay
5. Profit deposits in 1-5 days (PayPal/Bank)

**Pro Tips:**
- Ship same day = better seller rating
- Add tracking to every package
- Save all boxes/packing materials

## 💰 REAL EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH

**Example Flip:**

**Found:** Nintendo Switch Lite on Facebook Marketplace for $120
**Checked eBay Sold:** Recent sales averaging $180
**Listed:** At $179 with free shipping
**Sold:** In 3 days for $179

**Profit Calculation:**
```
Sale Price:        $179.00
eBay Fee (15%):    -$26.85
PayPal Fee (3%):   -$5.37
Shipping:          -$8.50
Cost of Goods:     -$120.00
────────────────────────────
Net Profit:        $18.28
ROI:               15.2%
Time Invested:     1 hour
Hourly Rate:       $18.28/hr
```

Not amazing, but you just made $18 in an hour from your couch.

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

**1. Buying Too High**
- Always check SOLD listings, not active listings
- Factor in all fees (15% eBay + 3% PayPal + shipping)
- If profit < $10, skip it

**2. Slow Shipping**
- Ship same day = 5-star reviews
- Late shipping = bad ratings = fewer sales

**3. Poor Photos**
- Blurry photos = no sales
- Use natural light, clean background
- Show all angles + any flaws

**4. Not Checking Condition**
- "New" = sealed in original packaging
- "Like New" = opened but unused
- "Excellent" = minor wear
- Be honest or get returns/bad reviews

**5. Ignoring Fees**
```
eBay Final Value Fee: 12-15%
PayPal Fee: 2.9% + $0.30
Shipping: $5-15 average
Packaging: $1-3 per item
────────────────────────────
Total Fees: ~20-25% of sale price
```

Always calculate this BEFORE buying!

## 💡 PRO TIPS FROM $100K+ ARBITRAGE SELLERS

1. **The 3X Rule**
   - Only buy if you can sell for 3X what you paid
   - Covers all fees + profit margin
   - Example: Buy for $30 → Sell for $90

2. **Buy in Bulk**
   - Lot of 10 items = cheaper per unit
   - List individually for max profit
   - Example: Buy 10 t-shirts for $50 → Sell each for $20 = $200 revenue

3. **Seasonal Arbitrage**
   - Buy winter clothes in summer (cheap)
   - Sell winter clothes in November (expensive)
   - Same with Christmas decorations, etc.

4. **Use "Sell-Through Rate"**
   - Check how many of same item have sold recently
   - High sell-through (50%+) = list it
   - Low sell-through (<20%) = skip it

5. **Start with What You Know**
   - Into gaming? Flip video games
   - Into fashion? Flip clothes
   - Use your expertise as an advantage

## 💰 ZERO CAPITAL METHOD (If You Have $0)

**"Sell First, Buy Later" Dropshipping:**

1. List item on eBay (you don't own it yet)
2. Customer buys from you
3. You buy from cheaper source
4. Ship directly to customer
5. Keep the difference

**Example:**
- List: "Apple AirPods Pro" for $200
- Customer buys
- You buy from Walmart.com for $170
- Ship to customer's address
- Profit: $30 (no upfront capital needed)

**⚠️ Risks:**
- Source might sell out
- Shipping delays = bad reviews
- Requires good supplier relationships
